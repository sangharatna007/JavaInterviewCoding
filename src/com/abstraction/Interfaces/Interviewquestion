Java Interview Questions On Interfaces :
1) Can interfaces have constructors, SIB and IIB?

No. Interfaces can’t have constructors, SIB and IIB. They show 100% abstractness.

2) Can we re-assign a value to a field of interfaces?

No. The fields of interfaces are static and final by default. They are just like constants. You can’t change their value once they got.

3) Can we declare an Interface with “abstract” keyword?

Yes, we can declare an interface with “abstract” keyword. But, there is no need to write like that. All interfaces in java are abstract by default.

4) For every Interface in java, .class file will be generated after compilation. True or false?

True. .class file will be generated for every interface after compilation.

5) Can we override an interface method with visibility other than public?

No. While overriding any interface methods, we should use public only. Because, all interface methods are public by default and you should not reduce the visibility while overriding them.

6) Can interfaces become local members of the methods?

No. You can’t define interfaces as local members of methods like local inner classes. They can be a part of top level class or interface.

7) Can an interface extend a class?

No, a class can not become super interface to any interface. Super interface must be an interface. That means, interfaces don’t extend classes but can extend other interfaces.

8) Like classes, does interfaces also extend Object class by default?

No. Interfaces don’t extend Object class. ( Click here for more )

10) Can an interface have a class or another interface as it’s members?

Yes. Interfaces can have classes or interfaces as their members.
