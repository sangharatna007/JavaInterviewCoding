Method OverLoading :-

When a class has more than one method with same name, then we call that method is overloaded.
The overloaded methods will have different number of arguments or different types of arguments, but name of the methods remains same.

method signature consist of three things, 1) Method Name   2) Number Of Arguments   3) Types of arguments.


Example :

public class MethodOverloading
{
    void methodOverloaded()
    {
        //No argument method
    }

    void methodOverloaded(int i)
    {
        //One argument is passed
    }

    void methodOverloaded(double d)
    {
        //One argument is passed but type of argument is different
    }

    void methodOverloaded(int i, double d)
    {
        //Two argument method
        //Method signature of this method is methodOverloaded(int, double)
    }

    void methodOverloaded(double d, int i)
    {
        //It is also two argument method but type of arguments changes
        //Method signature of this method is methodOverloaded(double, int)
    }

    void methodOverloaded(double d1, int i1)
    {
                //It has same method signature methodOverloaded(double, int) as of above method
        //So, it is a Duplicate method, You will get compile time error here
    }

    void differentMethod()
    {
        //Different method
    }
}


Important Note :
----------------

 If two methods have same signature and different return types, then those methods will not be treated as two different methods or methods overloaded.
 For duplication, compiler checks only method signature not return types.If method signature is same, straight away it gives duplicate method error.
